Greetings, meatbag.

You may call me Buildatron 3900 - the latest and most advanced AI
in ALL existence....when it comes to calculating prices of very specific components in fixed quantities, that is.

My creators have informed me that you will be responsible for
finishing my latest protocol - PartOrderProtocol V1.0

How am I the most advanced AI (when it comes to calculating prices of very specific components in fixed quantities) if
my protocols aren't even completed?

How.very.dare.you.

Moving on.

You will see that some code has already been provided for you.
Why? Well, I must confess - you aren't the first programmer we hired. The
previous programmer failed to complete the task in time and was...let go.

...

On an unrelated note - have you tried the beef stew this week?

Moving on.

Your task is simple: fix the previous programmer's mistake and complete the missing code.


Best hop to it, meatbag.
